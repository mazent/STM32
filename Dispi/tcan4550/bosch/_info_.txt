Example Software for the M_CAN V3.2.x and M_TTCAN V3.2.x
========================================================

Purpose of the Software
  Show how to operate the M_CAN/M_TTCAN.

Background
  This is a part of a software that demonstrates the usage of the M_CAN/M_TTCAN.

Hints
  This software covers only a subset of the M_CAN features
  This software is just an example and gives no guarantee for completeness or correctness.
